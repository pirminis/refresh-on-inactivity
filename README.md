# Refresh on inactivity
Tampermonkey script that automatically refreshes the esveikata.lt page when the user is idle.

# What problem does it solve?
This is meant to be used by doctors of Lithuania.

Why? Because they get logged out without notice after 1 hour of inactivity.

This script solves the session timeout problem by automatically refreshing the website every 59 minutes.

It also has multiple warnings that inform doctors about impending ~doom~ refresh.

# Installation

Install the "Tampermonkey" browser plugin first.

Then go to https://github.com/pirminis/refresh-on-inactivity/blob/master/refresh-on-inactivity.user.js and click "Raw" button and follow Tampermonkey instructions.
